This is my google homepage project from my course on The Odin Project. It's my first web project and I found it confusing, all the more so because I had to take a break midway through due to work and getting back into it was confusing to say the least.

What I've learned:
    Where to begin....this is my first attempt at anything like this so, basically everything. But more specifically: 

    Margins/Padding - I'm still pretty shaky with this stuff but I'm beginning to understand how important it is and the difference between the two.

    STRUCTURE IS KEY - A little bit of pre-planning to give the HTML/CSS some organisation would have saved me a lot of trouble. I started structuring more a bit into the project which helped a lot but it was more like damage-control. This ain't jazz, improv is not a strength...


What I could have done better:
    Again, pre-planning and organisation would have made things a lot better. The HTML particularly could be a bit neater.

    I still have a ways to go with getting the CSS to behave. The whole page has a pretty janky finish but ultimately I thought it was better to move on than to sink more time into trying to get it perfect.

    I need to get a better understanding of Flex and Grid. I was really struggling with this stuff and I think it'll make things a lot easier.

    I have a loooong way to go before I feel comfortable with this stuff so would like to dedicate more time to it while I can over the next month.
